Summary:

In this case, the conditional statements required to choose the sorting method that will be applied to the numbers
have been entirely eliminated using the interface. We can extract the methods into an interface (SortStrategy) and
each implementation of the interface will have the respective sorting algorithm. If Insertion Sort is the
sorting algorithm that we wish to add or delete, we may implement the SortStrategy interface and send it to the
sort function. We are currently sorting the numbers by passing the sorting algorithm along with them.
The family of algorithms in this case sorting algorithms have been encapsulated and made interchangeable.
It is called Strategy Design Pattern.
